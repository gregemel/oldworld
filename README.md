# World
I am learning to do behavior driven development with Java and jUnit.  Although I'm experienced with BDD and SOA, I am new to Java.  This project exists only to help me practice and better understand Java and jUnit.

World is an experiment to create working virtual world mechanisms using behavior driven development and service oriented architecture.  This is need-based development driven by an imaginary specification.  There is only enough implementation to cover "the need."

All objects are separated into models (objects that hold data but have no behavior) and services (objects that have behavior but not state).  Each service object performs action(s) on model(s).
